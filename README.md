# File recommendations

This project focuses on making file recommendation models.

## Step & installation

1. Create and enter a virtual environment
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python -m nltk.downloader all` (overkill, but useful for later experimentation)

## Development

All code is stored in notebooks. Begin with `file_cleaning.ipynb`.
